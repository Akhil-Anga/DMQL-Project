# Healthcare Appointment No-Show — Phase 1 (OLTP Database Foundation)

## DMQL Course Project – Phase 1 Submission

## Project Overview:

This project builds a complete OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) database foundation for analyzing patient appointment behavior using the Medical Appointment No-Show Dataset.

## Dataset Description

This project uses the **Medical Appointment No-Show Dataset** (Healthcare.csv), which contains information about patient appointments and whether the patient showed up.

- Source: Kaggle — Medical Appointment No Shows
- File used: `Data/Healthcare.csv`
- Rows: ~110,526
- Columns: 14

### Raw Attributes:
- PatientId
- AppointmentID
- Gender
- ScheduledDay
- AppointmentDay
- Age
- Neighbourhood
- Scholarship
- Hipertension
- Diabetes
- Alcoholism
- Handcap
- SMS_received
- No-show

### Why this dataset works for Phase 1:
- It is originally **denormalized** (flat CSV)
- Contains mixed data types (strings, timestamps, integers, boolean-like fields)
- Ideal for demonstrating **3NF decomposition** into:
  - Neighborhood
  - Patient
  - Appointment
- Suitable for OLTP modeling and ingestion pipelines

### Phase 1 includes:

-> Designing a normalized 3NF relational schema

-> Creating tables in PostgreSQL with proper constraints

-> Developing a Python data ingestion pipeline (Pandas + SQLAlchemy)

-> Running automated validation and diagnostic tests

-> Setting up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) — (Bonus Completed!)

This README provides complete instructions for running, testing, and verifying Phase 1.

### How to Run Phase 1
#### 1. Install Dependencies

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Install all required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Start PostgreSQL + pgAdmin (Docker)

From the project root:
```
docker compose up -d
```

To stop everything:
```
docker compose down -v
```

Verify containers:
```
docker ps
```

You should see:

-> healthcare_db

-> gadmin_ui

#### 3. Test Database Connection

Run:
```
python test_connection.py
```

Expected:
```
Attempting to connect...
Database connection successful: Connection OK
```

#### 4. Run the Data Ingestion Pipeline
```
python ingest_data.py
```

This script:

-> Loads raw dataset → Data/Healthcare.csv

-> Cleans, transforms, and normalizes the data

-> Inserts into PostgreSQL in FK-safe order:

    1. neighborhood
    2. patient
    3. appointment

Expected output:
```
Inserting neighborhoods...
Inserting patients...
Inserting appointments...
Data ingestion completed successfully.
```

#### 5. Run Full Validation Tests
```
python test.py
```

This script checks:
-> Required tables exist
-> Row counts
-> Foreign key integrity
-> Sample analytical query

Example output:
```
neighborhood: 81 rows
patient: 62298 rows
appointment: 110521 rows
All appointments have a valid patient_id.
```

#### 6. View Database in pgAdmin

Open:

👉 http://localhost:8080

Login using values from docker-compose:

    -> Email: admin@admin.com

    -> Password: admin123

Run queries such as:
```
SELECT * FROM appointment LIMIT 10;
```

#### 7. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Run the security script:
```
docker exec -it healthcare_db psql -U admin -d healthcare_db -f /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/security.sql
```

Created roles:
##### analyst — Read-Only Role
```
    1. Can connect
    2. Can read all tables
    3. Cannot insert/update/delete
```

To test:
```
SET ROLE analyst;
SELECT * FROM patient LIMIT 5;   -- Works
INSERT INTO patient VALUES (...); -- Fails (read-only)
```

##### app_user — Read-Write Role
```
    1. Can connect
    2. Can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
    3. Cannot create/drop tables
```

To test:
```
SET ROLE app_user;
INSERT INTO neighborhood(name) VALUES ('TEST_AREA'); -- Works
```

Both roles are fully functional and validated in pgAdmin.
